You need Python installed for this along with pip and pygame. Install python 3 at Python.org or the Microsoft Store. To check if it is installed enter 
'python --version' into Command Prompt and it will show a version e.g. 3.10.10 (my personal python version and also the once I recommend if you want minimal bugs when 
playing). Then install pip. I am not sure how (I already had it) but the way to check if it is installed is also by typing 'pip --version' into command prompt.
Once those are both installed, type 'pip install pygame' or something like that and wait for it to say it has installed sucessfully. Then, go to the windows 
batch file named main and double click. It may take a few seconds but then the game will run.
